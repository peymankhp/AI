Roadmap for learning Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)

1. Mathematics and Programming Foundations
Before diving into ML/AI-specific topics, you should strengthen your foundation in programming and mathematics.
Key Topics:
	•	Programming (Python/Matlab/R): Python is the most widely used language for AI/ML due to its extensive libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn). If you're already familiar with Python, focus on advanced aspects:
	◦	Data structures (lists, sets, dictionaries, queues, stacks)
	◦	Object-oriented programming (OOP)
	◦	Debugging, testing, and optimization
	•	Mathematics for ML/AI: ML relies heavily on various mathematical concepts.
	◦	Linear Algebra: Vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Essential for understanding data representation, transformations, and neural networks.
	◦	Probability and Statistics: Concepts like distributions, Bayes' theorem, hypothesis testing, and maximum likelihood estimation are foundational to building models.
	◦	Calculus: Understanding derivatives, gradients, and optimization algorithms like gradient descent.
	◦	Optimization: Gradient descent, convex optimization, Lagrange multipliers, etc.
