Train a predictive model on the data from Gold_Price_TA_training.xlsx and test the model on Gold_Price_TA_test.xlsx. The task involves performing data processing, training a deep learning model, and evaluating its performance. The goal is to forecast gold prices and analyze the predictions against actual values on a daily and weekly basis.
Steps:

    Data Loading & Preprocessing:
        Load Gold_Price_TA_training.xlsx, where the first column is the date (from the start date to 1/2/2020), and the 'Close' column is the target output (Y). All other columns are the input features (X).
        Similarly, load Gold_Price_TA_test.xlsx for the test data, which spans from 1/3/2020 to 12/1/2022.
        Handle missing values, outliers, and perform normalization of the data.
        Ensure proper time-series preprocessing, including handling rolling window calculations for time-series models.

    Model Development:
        Use a suitable deep learning architecture for time-series forecasting, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformers, or XGBoost.
        Implement hyperparameter tuning techniques (e.g., Optuna or GridSearch) to optimize model performance.

    Training & Evaluation:
        Train the model using the training dataset (Gold_Price_TA_training.xlsx).
        Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
        Implement cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the model.

    Visualization:
        Generate the following charts:
            A real vs. predicted chart for the training data.
            A real vs. predicted chart for the test data.

    Prediction & Comparison:
        Use the trained model to predict on the test dataset (Gold_Price_TA_test.xlsx) for the period between 1/3/2020 and 12/1/2022.
        Plot a comparison between real and predicted values on both a daily and weekly basis.
        Calculate the accuracy and other relevant statistics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) for both daily and weekly predictions.

    Model Optimization:
        Based on the accuracy and performance metrics, fine-tune the model for better predictions and optimization.
